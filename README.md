# Handwritten-Digit-string-Recognition

- Handwritten Multi digit recognition is performed using a sequence based CRNN model ( Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network), which extracts meaningful features from sequencial window.
- In this repository, I implemented a CRNN model with CTC Loss on our custom made Multi-digit numbers with decimals dataset to perform detection and recognition

## Training ##

Run the Custom_OCR.ipynb and save the model weights

## Inference ## 

Run the Digit_Recognition.ipynb using the saved model weight. 

## Results ##
